title: Geoana

This is an example of using `geoana` in JupyterLite. Press the play button at the top of the embedded figures to show the interactive apps. This example is running entirely in your browser. ðŸ¤¯

```{figure} #app:magnetic_dipole_whole_space

```

This is just the default `interactive` from `ipywidgets`, nothing special there, you can click on the source to see the notebook!

```{figure} #app:static_vector_potentials

```
